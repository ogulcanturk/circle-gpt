# GPT for Communities

"GPT for Communities" is an innovative open-source project that harnesses the power of the Circle Community API to extract posts from online communities. It securely summarizes these posts and transforms them into vector representations, which are then stored in an Upstash Vector database. Built on Node.js, the project seamlessly integrates with a ChatGPT model to provide users with relevant information and guidance based on the content of their community.

*Here are some key objectives of the project:*
- To create an intelligent assistant that leverages community content to offer valuable insights and support to users.
- To attract more users to the community by providing quick and easy access to summarized knowledge and information.
